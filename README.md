A simple browser history tracker for my research project :)

chrome_implementation:

A real chrome extension is implemented which gets the user browsing history and put it into the database.Then 
visualisation is done on that.

test_implementation 

A test implementation is simply used to get the csv file and format it in such a way that we can visualise it. Its just 
to ease the implementation during testing.
